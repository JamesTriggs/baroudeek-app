## Core Components

### Frontend Application
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for complex application state
- **Routing**: React Router v6 for client-side navigation
- **Maps**: Leaflet.js for interactive map functionality
- **UI Components**: Material-UI for consistent design system
- **Real-time**: Socket.io-client for WebSocket communication

### Backend API
- **Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance async API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for spatial data
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and data caching
- **Real-time**: WebSocket support for collaborative features
- **Task Queue**: Celery for background processing

### Database Design
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with PostGIS for spatial operations
- **Spatial Indexing**: GiST indexes for efficient spatial queries
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery

## Key Features

### Route Planning Algorithm
- Multi-factor scoring system for road quality
- Graph-based pathfinding with custom cost functions
- Real-time route optimization based on user preferences
- Machine learning integration for continuous improvement

### Real-time Collaboration
- WebSocket-based real-time updates
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Session management with invite codes
- Live cursor tracking and synchronized interactions

### Community Features
- Crowdsourced road quality ratings
- Usage heatmaps from anonymized GPS data
- Photo uploads and reviews for road segments
- Gamification with points and badges

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with proper expiration and refresh
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting on all API endpoints

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests
- HTTPS enforcement in production

### Privacy
- Optional GPS tracking with clear consent
- Data anonymization for usage analytics
- GDPR compliance for user data handling
- Secure deletion of user data on request

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Docker Compose for local development
- Hot reloading for both frontend and backend
- Automated database migrations
- Development seed data

### Production Environment
- Containerized deployment on AWS/DigitalOcean
- Load balancer for high availability
- CDN for static asset delivery
- Monitoring and alerting system

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Performance
- Code splitting for reduced initial bundle size
- Lazy loading of map tiles and route data
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features

### Backend Performance
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Connection pooling for database connections
- Async processing for non-blocking operations

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of API servers
- Database read replicas for query distribution
- Redis clustering for session scaling
- CDN integration for global content delivery
