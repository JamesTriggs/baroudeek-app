# Baroudeek Project Specification

## Project Overview

Baroudeek is a cycling route discovery and adventure platform that helps cyclists find, plan, and experience cycling routes using AI-powered analysis and community-driven data. The name comes from "baroudeur" - a cycling term for an aggressive, opportunistic rider who seeks adventure.

## Core Features

### 🚴‍♂️ **Intelligent Route Planning**
- **Cycling-optimized routing** using OpenRouteService API
- **Real-time route generation** with interactive waypoint placement
- **Elevation profiles** with ascent/descent calculations
- **Surface quality preferences** (smooth roads, avoid gravel)
- **Traffic avoidance** (busy roads, highways, dual carriageways)
- **Multiple route options** (fastest, safest, most scenic)

### 👥 **Real-time Collaboration**
- **Simultaneous planning** - Multiple users can plan routes together
- **Live cursor tracking** - See where collaborators are clicking
- **Voice/chat integration** - Communicate while planning
- **Permission levels** - Owner, editor, viewer access
- **Session invites** - Share planning sessions via links

### 🛣️ **Community-Driven Data**
- **Road quality ratings** - Crowdsourced surface quality data
- **Safety ratings** - Community reports on road safety
- **Usage heatmaps** - Popular cycling routes visualization
- **Route reviews** - Community feedback on saved routes
- **Photo integration** - Geotagged photos of routes/hazards

### 📊 **Advanced Analytics**
- **Route statistics** - Distance, time, elevation, difficulty
- **Performance tracking** - Compare planned vs actual times
- **Weather integration** - Route recommendations based on conditions
- **Seasonal variations** - Route popularity by time of year
- **Personal insights** - Your cycling patterns and preferences

## API Specifications

### Route Planning API
```typescript
// Generate route
POST /api/routes/generate
Body: {
  waypoints: [{ lat: number, lng: number }],
  preferences: {
    avoidHighways: boolean,
    surfacePreference: 'smooth' | 'any',
    maxGradient: number
  }
}

// Save route
POST /api/routes
Body: {
  name: string,
  waypoints: Waypoint[],
  geometry: GeoJSON,
  isPublic: boolean
}
```

### Community API
```typescript
