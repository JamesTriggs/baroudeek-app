# Road Quality Scoring System Design

## 🎯 Crowd-Sourced Quality Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. **Database Schema for Road Quality**
   - Road segments (linked to OSM way IDs)
   - User votes/ratings per segment
   - Ride frequency heatmap data
   - Surface condition reports

2. **OpenStreetMap Integration**
   - Fetch existing surface/smoothness tags
   - Use as baseline quality scores
   - Supplement with crowd-sourced data

### Phase 2: User Voting System (Waze-style)
1. **During Ride Reporting**
   - Tap to report: "Great surface" / "Poor surface" / "Pothole"
   - Quick emoji reactions: 😍🙂😐😞😠
   - Voice commands while riding
   - Automatic detection via phone sensors

2. **Post-Ride Rating**
   - Rate route segments 1-5 stars
   - Category-specific ratings:
     - Surface Quality
     - Traffic Safety
     - Scenery
     - Overall Experience

### Phase 3: Heatmap-Based Scoring
1. **Usage Popularity Bonus**
   - Roads with more cyclist activity = higher base score
   - Weight recent activity more heavily
   - Factor in ride completion rates

2. **Speed Analysis**
   - Faster average speeds = likely better surface
   - Sudden slowdowns = potential issues
   - Consistent speeds = good road quality

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Sources Priority:
1. **User votes** (highest weight - real cyclist experience)
2. **Heatmap usage** (medium weight - popularity indicates quality)
3. **OpenStreetMap tags** (baseline - static data)
4. **Speed analysis** (low weight - supplementary indicator)

### Quality Score Algorithm:
```
Final Score = (
  UserVotes * 0.50 +
  HeatmapPopularity * 0.25 +
  OSMTags * 0.15 +
  SpeedAnalysis * 0.10
) * RecentActivityMultiplier
```

### Anti-Gaming Measures:
- Require minimum ride distance to vote
- Weight votes by user reputation
- Detect and filter fake/spam reports
- Geographic clustering validation

## 📊 Data Storage Strategy

### Road Segment Database:
```sql
road_segments:
  - way_id (OSM reference)
  - surface_type (from OSM)
  - smoothness_rating (from OSM)
  - user_votes_avg
  - total_rides_count
  - last_updated

user_reports:
  - segment_id
  - user_id
  - rating (1-5)
  - report_type (surface/traffic/scenic)
  - timestamp
  - location_confidence
```
